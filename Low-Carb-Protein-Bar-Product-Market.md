Several key factors will shape this demand:</p><ul> <li><strong>Continued Popularity of Keto and Low-Carb Diets:</strong> As keto, paleo, and low-carb diets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the demand for low-carb snacks—especially protein bars—is anticipated to rise dramatically.</li> <li><strong>Health and Wellness Focus:</strong> Consumers are becoming more aware of the long-term health benefits of reducing sugar intake and increasing protein consumption.

Companies will need to differentiate themselves through flavor innovations, branding, and sustainability initiatives.</li> <li><strong>Regulatory Issues:</strong> Governments worldwide are introducing new regulations around food labeling and health claims.
